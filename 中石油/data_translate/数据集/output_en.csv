"Endeavor Group Holdings (EDR.N), an entertainment and talent agency company backed by Hollywood power broker Ari Emanuel with a track record of losses, made a last-minute decision to abandon its IPO due to the tough market conditions. Taking a lesson from the struggles earlier in 2019 of ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies (UBER.N) and Lyft Inc (LYFT.O), which have no stated timetable for becoming profitable, investors have started to push back on companies with a history of steep losses. ""It will be a dialogue among bankers and boards and senior management teams where they say, ""these were isolated and not comparable,"" or say ""we have a sentiment shift and we need to be more conservative and use a different strategy,"""" said David Ethridge, U.S. IPO services leader at audit firm PwC. The market was more receptive to lesser-known names such as cyber security company Ping Identity PING.N and cloud monitoring company Datadog Inc DDOG.O. Both companies have reported more modest losses and rely on selling to companies rather than to consumers.",由好莱坞重量级经纪人阿里・伊曼纽尔支持的娱乐及人才经纪公司 Endeavor Group Holdings (EDR.N) 因市场形势严峻，在最后一刻决定放弃首次公开募股，该公司过去曾有过亏损记录。2019 年早些时候，约车公司优步科技 (UBER.N) 和 Lyft Inc (LYFT.O) 还没有明确的盈利时间表，吸取了这两家公司的教训，投资者已经开始推迟投资那些有严重亏损历史的公司。“这将是银行家、董事会和高级管理团队之间的对话，他们会说，‘这些是孤立的，不可比较的'，或者说，‘我们的情绪发生了转变，我们需要更加保守，并使用不同的战略'”，普华永道会计师事务所美国首次公开募股服务主管的大卫・埃思里奇说道。市场更容易接纳一些不太知名的公司，比如网络安全公司 Ping Identity (PING.N) 和云监测公司 Datadog Inc (DDOG.O)。这两家公司的亏损都较为温和，而且主要是向公司而非消费者销售产品。
"First, the displacement will be increased significantly compared to the current 054A model. It is estimated that the displacement of the new frigate will reach about 5000-6000 tons. The ship will be equipped with a comprehensive electric propulsion system that combines a QC280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines, improving the maximum speed to around 30 knots and significantly increase the cruise range. As for the weaponry, the 76mm main gun and 1130 near-range anti-aircraft gun will be retained, but a HQ-10 launch system will be added. A shared vertical launching system for 32-48 unit HQ-16 modified missile and Fish-8 missiles will be furnished at the back of the main gun. A large 8-16-unit vertical launching system should be furnished at the middle-to-rear section of the hull for the launch of YJ-18 and new cruise missiles. Hangars and parking platforms will also be expanded for the parking and storage of two 10-ton helicopters. As for the electronic radar systems, the high grade model will be equipped with a small four-sided fixed phase-control array radar developed based on 346A. the low grade model will be furnished with multi-function rotating phased array radar similar to the ones on European frigates.",首先来说排水量相对于现在的054A型护卫舰将有一个大幅度的增加，估计新型护卫舰的排水量会达到5000-6000吨左右;动力系统将会采用有一台QC280改进型燃气轮机和两台柴油机组成的综合电力推进系统，最高航速有望达到30节左右，续航力也会大幅度增加;至于武器配置76毫米主炮和1130近防炮应该会保留，但是会增加一座红旗10发射系统，主炮后面应该会有一个32-48单元红旗16改进型和鱼-8共架的垂发系统，在舰体中后方应该会加装一个8-16单元的大型垂发系统用于发射鹰击18和新型巡航导弹;机库和停机平台也会增大，达到两架10吨级直升机的停放和存放;至于电子雷达系统方面，高配的话应该会装备基于346A发展的小型四面固定相控阵雷达，低配的话可以使用类似于欧洲护卫舰上的多功能旋转相控阵雷达。
"Romania and Bulgaria, located on the Black Sea coast, which in the past were allies of the USSR, have joined NATO and the EU since its collapse. In response to Russia's actions, they have asked the alliance to strengthen its presence in the region, writes The Times. In February, 500 US troops arrived at Romania's air base. An Eurofighter Typhoon fighter squadron of the British Air Force is stationed and deployed. Since April last year, these aircraft have repeatedly intercepted Russian fighter jets. Georgia, located on the eastern Black Sea coast, is also concerned about Russia's aspirations. It is not a member of the alliance, but is involved in NATO military exercises. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said during a visit to Tbilisi in March that the alliance was ""preparing"" Georgia for accession. Ukraine has also participated in NATO exercises in the region and has been developing its engagement with the Union since 2014.",罗马尼亚和保加利亚位于黑海沿岸，过去曾是苏联的盟友，在苏联解体后加入了北约和欧盟。《泰晤士报》称，为回应俄罗斯的行动，他们要求北约加强其在该地区的势力。2 月，500 名美军抵达罗马尼亚的空军基地。英国空军的欧洲台风战斗机中队已驻扎并完成部署。自去年 4 月以来，这些飞机已经多次拦截俄罗斯战斗机。位于黑海东部沿海的格鲁吉亚也对俄罗斯的勃勃野心感到担忧。它不是北约成员，但参加了北约军事演习。北约秘书长延斯・斯托尔滕贝格在 3 月份访问第比利斯时表示，北约正在为格鲁吉亚加入“做准备”。乌克兰也参加了北约在该地区的演习，自 2014 年以来一直在发展与欧盟的关系。
"Interestingly, one of the 12 galaxies in z66OD was a giant object with a huge body of gas, known as Himiko, which was found previously by the Subaru Telescope in 2009. ""It is reasonable to find a protocluster near a massive object, such as Himiko. However, we're surprised to see that Himiko was located not in the center of the protocluster, but on the edge 500 million light-years away from the center."" said Masami Ouchi, a team member at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and the University of Tokyo, who discovered Himiko in 2009. Ironically, the mythological queen Himiko is also said to have lived cloistered away from her people. Ouchi continues, ""It is still not understood why Himiko is not located in the center. These results will be a key for understanding the relationship between clusters and massive galaxies.""",有趣的是，在 z66OD 的 12 个星系中，有一个是在 2009 年通过斯巴鲁望远镜发现的大型星系卑弥呼，其中包含了大量气体。卑弥呼星系发现者日本国家天文台和东京大学的团队成员长泽正美提到：“在卑弥呼这样的大质量天体附近是有可能发现原星团的。然而，我们惊讶的是，卑弥呼并不是位于原星系团的中心，而是在距离中心 5 亿光年的边缘上”。讽刺的是，神话中的皇后卑弥呼据说也是过着与世隔绝的生活。正美继续谈到：“目前尚不清楚为什么卑弥呼不在中间位置。但是这些结果将是了解星系团和大质量星系之间关系的重要信息。”

"First, let's examine the more pessimistic side. De Grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break. It was a violent and unpredictable attack. He suffers from schizophrenia, which is why he was found not criminally responsible, but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication. His psychiatrist, Dr. Santoch Rai, has said in front of the review board that ""if Matthew de Grood were to commit another offence, it would be severe."" Despite his perceived improvement, there is still risk of re-offense. But is this reason enough to remain afraid? Is it enough to keep de Grood locked up?",首先，让我们看看较为悲观的一面。德・格罗德确实在精神病发作期间捅死了 5 个人。这是一次不可预测的暴力袭击。他患有精神分裂症，这就是为什么他被裁定不负刑事责任，但此后一直在看精神病医生和服用药物。他的精神科医生桑托克・雷曾在审查委员会面前表示，“如果马修・德・格罗德再次犯法，那将后果严重。” 尽管他感觉有进步，但仍有再次攻击他人的风险。但这个理由足以令人继续害怕吗？这个理由足够把德格罗德关起来吗？
"The problem did not stop there. As house prices continue to fall, a new situation emerged: The money the bank got after auctioning the defaulted house was less than the loan the home buyer owed the bank, the home buyer still need to repay the loan. So stopping repayment does not necessarily mean that you are cleaned of the debt. For example, if you paid a down payment of $600,000 and borrowed $2.4 million to buy a house worth $3 million at the time. When the house price falls to $2 million, you stop to repay the loan and give the house to the bank. After the bank auctions the house, you will not only lost your down payment of $600,000, but also owed $400,000 debts to the bank. You still have to repay the debt.",而问题不止如此，因为房价的持续下跌，大家停止还贷把房子给银行之后并不是你就没有债务了，如果银行拍卖房子得到的钱还还不上你欠银行的贷款的话，那么你还是需要接着还钱，简单点说假设你用首付60万，贷款240万买了一套当时价值300万的房子，当房价下跌到这个房子只值200万的时候，你不再还贷把房子给了银行，银行拍卖房子之后，你不仅损失了自己的首付60万，还倒欠银行40万的债务，你还是要接着还钱。
"Google is marking its own birthday today with a doodle. The doodle features a photo of a 90s' style computer with Google search page and date stamp for September 27, 1998, surrounded by confetti in Google colours. A smaller doodle with number 21 as candles, as a part of Google logo, shows on the search results page. The search giant was founded 21 years ago in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, then students at Stanford University in California. September 27 is, however, not Google's actual birthday.",谷歌今天用涂鸦庆祝自己的生日。涂鸦是一张 90 年代风格的电脑照片，上面有谷歌搜索页面和 1998 年 9 月 27 日的日期戳，周围是谷歌颜色的五彩纸屑。搜索结果页面上会显示一个较小的涂鸦，谷歌标志设计成数字 21 形状的蜡烛。这家搜索巨头是 21 年前由拉里・佩奇和谢尔盖・布林于 1998 年创立的，当时他们是加州斯坦福大学的学生。然而， 9 月 27 日并不是谷歌的真正生日。

"I don't believe de Grood should ever be unsupervised permanently. A parole-like system where he has to check in to make sure he's still taking his medication could work well. Arguing that he or other mentally ill people remain institutionalized unless absolutely necessary is a form of segregation. It perpetuates the idea that mentally ill people, those with schizophrenia in particular, cannot ever mesh with society; thus continuing the stigma and perpetuating the idea that they are dangerous criminals. He was found not criminally responsible by a court of law, so why should he be treated like a prisoner instead of someone who was ill and is now better?",我不认为德格罗德应该永远无人监管。通过一个类似假释制度进行监管，以确保他仍然在服用他的药物且药物有效。他辩称，除非绝对必要，否则他或其他精神病患者仍被收容是一种隔离。这会使精神病患者，特别是精神分裂症患者，永远无法融入社会；从而他们将继续被污名化，且视他们为危险罪犯的观念将永久化。法庭认定他不负刑事责任，为什么要把他当作囚犯对待，而不是把他当作一个生病了、现在康复了的人？

"Some people cannot afford to pay their mortgages because their incomes were too low. The banks began to take over the houses from the home buyers who had defaulted on the loan, and then sold them at very low prices, resulting in a step-by-step price fall in the area. This vicious cycle caused a further decline in housing prices. When the housing prices had fallen to a certain extent, more and more home buyers found that their house values became lower than their loans. Thus, more and more people stopped repaying their home mortgages, resulting in a large number of bad debts.",从而有人因为收入过低支付不起房贷，于是银行就开始收回房产，当银行从拖欠贷款的购房者手中收回房产之后，他们会以极低的价格售出，从而导致了该地区的房价一步步下滑，这个过程又引发了房价进一步的下滑，形成了一个恶性循环，当房价下跌到一定的程度之后，越来越多的购房者发现自己的房子价值甚至已经比自己的贷款还低了，于是就有了更多的人停止继续还房贷，又造成了更多的坏账。

"The 054A frigate has been favored by the Chinese Navy for many years thanks to its high cost performance and good combat effectiveness.

"As long as de Grood continues to take his medication, there isn't a huge risk of reoffense, so why are people so concerned? I believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness, particularly those with schizophrenia, largely influences this fear. Certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized, such as mood and anxiety disorders. But others, including schizophrenia, remain highly stigmatized. This is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people.",只要德・格罗德继续服药，再犯罪的风险就不会很大，那么人们为什么这么担心呢？我认为，人们对精神病患者，特别是精神分裂症患者的污名，很大程度上导致了这种恐惧。某些精神疾病已经变得不那么可怕了，比如情绪和焦虑障碍。但其他疾病，包括精神分裂症，仍然被高度污名化。这在很大程度上是因为许多人把精神分裂症患者描绘成危险人物，他们的脑袋里有声音告诉他们要杀人。
"With the launching of the latest model of 054A frigate at the end of 2017, the number of 054A frigate has reached 29, approaching the sum of the 053H series frigates.

Building such a large number of high-performance general purpose frigates is very rare in the history.

"As inflation climbs and the cost of living in Oregon soars, these workers are being left to flounder, and management has shown little sympathy for their plight. Contract negotiations that began in February broke down in mid-August. At that point, the bosses had laid out some particularly egregious proposals - a paltry cost-of-living increase, a denial of seniority demands from long-term university workers, and a price hike for staff meals - that workers saw as disrespectful, and even cruel.

The goal was to convince multinationals to bring back manufacturing jobs as money trickles down to the middle and poor classes. In practice, it seems, it led to extra bonuses for executives and the rest of the country largely missing out on the benefits a growing economy and record low unemployment. Well, someone needs to pay for all those private jet trips.",这还可能破坏现任政府实施的企业税收优惠政策背后的理念基础，这些政策于 2017 年获得国会的批准。其目的是说服跨国公司将制造业的工作岗位带回美国，同时让收入流向中产阶层和贫困阶层。而事实上，这些政策似乎只为高管们带来了额外收入，而其他大部分美国人则错失了经济增长和创纪录的低失业率带来的惠益。话说回来，总得有人为那些私人飞机的旅行买单。
"Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, the Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.",田纳西州的 Mike Organ 报道称，田纳西州立大学猛虎队 (Tennessee State Tigers) 于周六以31-27击败范德比尔特大学海军准将队 (Vanderbilt Commodores)，比赛中，猛虎队后卫球员克里斯蒂安・阿伯克龙比 (Christion Abercrombie) 头部受伤，随后接受了紧急手术。
"Grant Anderson's 14th minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but, a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, released for the game by Warriors, allowed Melrose to make numbers tell and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted try.",格兰特・安德森 (Grant Anderson) 在第 14 分钟的尝试使艾尔联暂时领先，随后被弗雷泽・克里莫 (Frazier Climo) 换下，但是由于在对抗勇士队的比赛中苏格兰队员罗里・休斯 (Hughes) 遭遇黄牌，使得梅尔罗斯队在人数上占据优势，而贾森・巴格特 (Jason Baggot) 则抓住了没有被换下场的机会。
"A radio host in New Orleans said he received an anti-gay slur, sent to him from the radio station's Twitter account. On Wednesday, WWL host Seth Dunlap, who is openly gay, said he planned to sue the station's parent company after working for years in a homophobic and hostile workplace. In a strange turn of events Thursday, the New Orleans Police Department said the homophobic tweet sent to Dunlap came from none other than Dunlap's phone.",新奥尔良的一名电台主持人表示他收到该电台的推特账户发给他的一条反同性恋诽谤推文。WWL 主持人赛斯・丹拉普是一名公开的同性恋者，他在星期三表示，他打算起诉电台母公司，因为多年以来他一直在一个厌恶同性恋且充满敌意的环境中工作。星期四，事情发生了离奇的反转，新奥尔良警察局称，丹拉普收到的恐同推文不是来自别处，而正是由丹拉普的手机发出的。
"And Oregon's state university workers aren't the only ones taking action. Oregon is a powder keg of militancy right now, and its fuse is now burning bright and hot. Grocery store workers at the Fred Meyer supermarket chain are ramping up their campaign against their employer, and while there are no official plans to strike yet, tensions are running high; their union, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 555, has already called for a boycott, and filed an unfair labor practice report against the chain.",俄勒冈州立大学的工作人员并不是唯一采取行动的人群。俄勒冈州现在是充满斗志的火药桶，保险丝已烧得又热又亮。弗雷德・迈耶连锁超市的杂货店工作人员正在紧锣密鼓地开展针对雇主的运动，虽然还没有正式的罢工计划，但紧张局势不断升级；他们的工会――食品和商业工人联合会本地 555 分会已经要求联合抵制，并针对该连锁店提出了不公平的劳工实践报告。
"Wang's death follows after those of other activists including grassroots lawyer Ji Sizun, who died in police custody in July, Uighur scholar Muhammad Salih Hajim who died last year. Nobel laureate winner Liu Xiaobo who was denied cancer treatment died in 2017 while serving an 11-year-prison sentence and activist Cao Shunli died in 2014, detained after attempting to attend a UN session on human rights in China.",在王美余之前，其他中国维权人士也遭遇过类似事件，如去年七月死在看守所的草根律师纪斯尊，以及去年逝世的维吾尔族学者穆罕默德・萨利赫・阿吉。2017 年，尚在狱中服刑（刑期 11 年）的诺贝尔奖得主刘小波罹患癌症，因当局拒绝为其治疗而病逝；2014年，维权人士曹顺利试图出席联合国召开的有关中国人权状况的会议，途中遭到拘留，随后亡故。

"Trump is singing from a similar songbook. His administration's Muslim-majority travel ban echoes the Islamophobia that often informs Modi's policymaking. Its callousness toward refugees mirrors the Indian government's disdain for the Rohingya population's suffering, and its detention camps parallel the ones the Modi regime is setting up. Trump's stirring of racial animosity is analogous to troublesome rhetoric from a number of Modi's cabinet members.",特朗普实施的政策也如出一辙。特朗姆政府对穆斯林占多数的国家实施的旅行禁令正是对伊斯兰恐惧症的响应，而这也正是莫迪制定政策常考虑的因素。其对难民的冷酷无情也是印度政府对罗兴亚人所遭受的苦难嗤之以鼻的写照，而美国的拘留营与莫迪政权建立的拘留营也大同小异。特朗普煽动种族仇恨的行为与莫迪内阁一些成员作出的令人头疼的说辞别无二致。
"The number of suicides across the military increased from 511 in 2017 to 541 in 2018. According to the Pentagon, the most at-risk population is young enlisted men, and at least 60 percent of the time they chose a gun as their suicide method. Army suicides went from 114 to 139, while the Marines went from 43 to 58 and the Navy went from 65 to 68. The Air Force dipped from 63 to 60.",美国全军自杀人数从 2017 年的 511 人增加至 2018 年的 541 人。据五角大楼称，危险系数最高的人群是年轻入伍者，至少有 60％ 的情况下，他们选择枪支作为自杀方式。陆军自杀人数从 114 增至 139，海军陆战队自杀人数从 43 增至 58，海军自杀人数从 65 增至 68。而空军从 63 下降至 60。
"In a December 2018 report the Energy Information Administration said it expected the United States"" LNG export capacity to double by the end of this year to 8.9 billion cu ft daily. This will make the US the third-largest exporter of LNG in terms of capacity after Qatar and Australia. By 2030, US LNG exports are estimated to reach 17 billion cu ft daily, from some 3 billion cu ft at the start of 2019.",美国能源信息署在 2018 年 12 月发布的一份报告中表示，预计到今年年底，美国的液化天然气出口能力会翻一番，达到每日 89 亿立方英尺。这也会让美国成为继卡塔尔和澳大利亚之后的世界第三大液化天然气出口国。预计到 2030 年，美国液化天然气出口量将从 2019 年初的 30 亿立方英尺增涨到每日 170 亿立方英尺。
"Using the Subaru, Keck, and Gemini Telescopes, an international team of astronomers has discovered a collection of 12 galaxies which existed about 13.0 billion years ago. This is the earliest protocluster ever found. One of the 12 galaxies is a giant object, known as Himiko, which was discovered a decade ago by the Subaru Telescope and named for a mythological queen in ancient Japan. This discovery suggests that large structures such as protoclusters already existed when the Universe was only about 800 million years old, 6 percent of its present age.",一个国际天文学家团队使用斯巴鲁、凯克和双子座望远镜，发现了大约 130 亿年前存在的 12 个星系。这是迄今为止发现的最古老的原星团。其中最大的星系是10 年前通过斯巴鲁望远镜发现的卑弥呼，它以日本古代神话中的女王而命名。这一发现表明，像原星系团这样的大型星系结构在宇宙形成仅 8 亿年时就已存在，只占现在年龄的 6%。
"A pink blanket goes with everything: Jane Austen classics, a queer young-adult romcom, fantasy novel Six of Crows.

"Since the 1960s, these viral capsids have been classified using the geometrical framework introduced by structural biologist Donald Caspar and biophysicist Aaron Klug, which were inspired by the geodesic domes designed by the renowned architect R. Buckminster Fuller. However, as molecular imaging techniques have advanced, an increasing number of 3D viral capsid reconstructions that included viruses like Herpes or Zika have fallen out from this classical geometrical framework.",受到著名建筑师巴克明斯特・富勒设计的测地线圆顶的启发，结构生物学家唐纳德・卡斯帕和生物物理学家阿隆・克鲁格引进了几何框架，自 20 世纪 60 年代以来，人们根据病毒衣壳的几何框架对病毒进行分类。然而，随着分子成像技术的逐渐进步，包括疱疹病毒和寨卡病毒在内的越来越多的三维病毒衣壳重建已经从这个经典的几何框架中脱离出来。
"The environmental problems addressed by Cullis-Suzuki reflect the world of the early 1990s, when deforestation, the depletion of the ozone layer, and the extinction of species were the ecological concerns de jour. Yet humanity has been fairly successful at resolving those problems in the intervening years. Thanks to a landmark chemicals ban, ozone depletion has slowed dramatically, and forest cover worldwide has increased by an area the size of Texas and Alaska combined.",铃木瑟玟疾呼的环境问题反映的是 20 世纪 90 年代初的世界，当时的生态问题聚焦在滥砍滥伐、臭氧层消耗和物种灭绝方面。但在实施了若干年的干预措施后，人类相当成功地解决了这些问题。得益于具有里程碑意义的化学品禁令，臭氧消耗速度显著减缓，而全球森林覆盖面积也大大增加，增加的面积相当于德克萨斯和阿拉斯加两个州面积的总和。
"In an ideal world, a series of blows landing on Johnson - who is also under fire over his rhetoric in the debate over Brexit - would bring the match closer to an end. Europe should still try to extract maximum concessions from the UK, given it has no choice but to negotiate with the current government while trying to preserve unity among the rest of its 27 member states - which is going to get harder the longer this drags on. If there's a window to try yet again to put a deal before the UK parliament, the EU should grab it.",约翰逊在英国脱欧辩论中因言辞不当而受到抨击，最理想的结果是，对他的一系列打击将使这场角逐接近尾声。欧洲别无选择，只能与英国现任政府进行谈判，同时努力维护其余 27 个成员国之间的团结，因此，欧洲仍应努力争取让英国做出最大让步，但时间拖得越久，越难以实现。如果还有机会再次和英国议会达成协议，欧盟应好好把握这样的机会。
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.,唐纳德・特朗普 (Donald Trump) 总统在周六举行的集会上嘲讽了参议员黛安娜・范斯坦 (Dianne Feinstein)，因为她坚称自己没有泄露有关克里斯汀・布莱西・福特 (Christine Blasey Ford) 指控最高法院候选人布雷特・卡瓦诺 (Brett Kavanaugh) 性侵的信件。

"The statement on Thursday comes amidst an explosive week in Washington rooted in a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the upcoming 2020 election, and the White House took steps to cover it up. A transcript of July phone conversation released by the White House on Wednesday shows Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.",该声明是在星期四发出的，这一周恰逢“告密者控告”在华盛顿引起轩然大波，“控告”指称特朗普在即将到来的 2020 年选举中滥用官方权力“寻求乌克兰总统沃洛德米尔・泽伦斯基的干预”，而白宫采取措施掩盖了此事。白宫在星期三发布的七月电话会谈文字记录显示，特朗普反复敦促泽伦斯基调查前副总统乔・拜登和他的儿子亨特。
"With the recent announcement of the construction of new types of frigates by major naval powers in the world, it seems that frigates have become the focus of attention of the major naval powers overnight. First, Japan has decided to purchase two new frigates in the 2018 annual defense budget, finally making a substantial breakthrough for its DEX frigates program. Later, Lockheed Martin of USA recently published the latest arrangement for the United States FFG frigates program. How about China's plan for building new type of frigates?",随着近期世界各大海军强国先后公布了新型护卫舰的建造计划，仿佛一夜之间护卫舰有成了各大强国海军关注的焦点，先是日本在2018年度防卫预算中确定采购两艘新型护卫舰，使得日本DEX护卫舰计划终于有了实质性的突破，后是美国洛克希德马丁于近期公布了美国FFG护卫舰计划的最新方案，那么中国的新型护卫舰该何去何从呢？

"More than half the members of the US House of Representatives have said they support an impeachment inquiry, according to a CNN count. However, that count includes many Democrats who say they support an impeachment investigation but are still waiting for the results of the probe before deciding whether to finally vote to impeach Trump. Even if the House could pass the vote, it likely would go nowhere in the Republican-controlled Senate, one of many reasons the issue has been politically divisive in the party.",据美国有线电视新闻网统计，超过一半的美国众议院议员表示支持弹劾调查。但是，这其中包括许多民主党人，他们虽然表示支持弹劾调查，但仍在等待结果，然后再决定是否最终投票支持弹劾特朗普。即使众议院可以投票通过弹劾条款，但还是会在共和党控制的参议院遭遇“拦路虎”，这也是该问题在民主党内引发政治分歧的诸多原因之一。
"""The President's comments today constitute reprehensible witness intimidation and an attempt to obstruct Congress' impeachment inquiry. We condemn the President's attacks, and we invite our Republican counterparts to do the same because Congress must do all it can to protect this whistleblower, and all whistleblowers,"" they said. ""Threats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whistleblower process, with grave consequences for our democracy and national security.""",他们说道，“总统今天的言论构成了对证人的恐吓，应该受到严厉谴责，这种行为妨碍了国会弹劾调查。我们谴责总统的攻击行为，并呼吁我们的共和党同僚也提出谴责，因为国会必须尽一切努力保护这位告密者和所有告密者。”“我们国家领导人的暴力威胁对整个举报程序产生了可怕的影响，也给我们的民主和国家安全带来了严重后果。”
"The moves by firms such as Skoda and BMW point to a potential shift in the way people interact with their cars. Hannah Keshishian, an automotive analyst at market intelligence firm Mintel, told CNBC via email that one of its recent reports had highlighted how nearly 40% of U.S. consumers who owned a vehicle ""would like to use a digital personal assistant in their vehicle."" This, she added, ""opens the door to greater possibilities for digital assistant vehicle connectivity.""",斯柯达和宝马等公司的行动表明，人们与汽车互动的方式可能发生变化。市场情报公司英敏特的汽车分析师汉娜・凯西西恩通过电子邮件告诉 CNBC 频道，该公司最近的一份报告重点阐述了为何近 40% 拥有汽车的美国消费者‘希望在汽车中使用个人数字助理'。” 她补充道，“这为汽车数字助理的未来发展创造了更多机会。”
"Yet European diplomats can also see that the political bedlam in the UK lends itself to delay without decisions. Lawmakers in Parliament were able to set aside their differences to tie Johnson's hands and seek an extension, but that's about all they can agree on. This is the same Parliament that rejected the former prime minister Theresa May's hard-fought Brexit deal with the EU three times. Unless there's an election - another decision on which MPs have a final say - that won't change.",然而，欧洲各国的外交官同时也看到，英国的政治僵局导致英国方面迟迟未做决定。议会的议员们能够搁置分歧，限制约翰逊的行动并寻求延期，但他们可以达成的全部共识仅止于此。正是这届议会曾三度拒绝前首相特雷莎・梅与欧盟艰难达成的英国脱欧协议。除非举行选举，这是另一件国会议员有权决定的事，否则事情不会有什么改变。
"Military and defense leaders expressed dismay and a resolve to do more to increase resilience in the force, train service members how to handle stress better and encourage troops to seek help when they need it. Van Winkle said the military is also looking at increasing efforts to train troops on the safe storage of firearms and medication. She said there are no consistent rules or regulations across the department and the services requiring gun locks or other controls on firearms, but that some states or bases have their own restrictions.",军事和国防领导人对此表示失望，并决心采取更多措施来提高部队的应变能力，培训军人如何更有效地应对压力，并鼓励部队人员在需要帮助时寻求帮助。范・文克说道，军方也在考虑加强部队安全存放枪支和药物方面的训练。她表示，部门之间没有统一的规则或法规来要求对枪支上锁或采取其他控制措施，但某些州或基地有自己的限制。

"Most US cinemas have banned masks, face paint and toy weapons after the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, which happened during a screening of another Batman flick, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" The gunman wore a Joker costume when he went on a gun and tear-gas rampage, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others. Body costumes that don't hide a person's identity, however, have been generally allowed in theaters.",多数美国院线已经禁止了观众佩戴面具、彩绘人脸或携带玩具武器，这是因为 2012 年另一部蝙蝠侠电影《黑暗骑士崛起》上映时，在科罗拉多奥罗拉市发生了重大枪击案。 当时枪手身穿小丑戏服，向观众开枪并投掷催泪弹，导致 12 人死亡，70 人受伤。但影院普遍还是允许观众穿着不隐藏个人身份的戏服进行观影的。
"Therefore, the fact that China’s household debt ratio has reached a high level of 46.8% is a problem that requires great vigilance. Although this figure is still lower than that of developed countries at present, the signs of the problem have already begun to emerge. The central government started to stress the issue of deleveraging repeatedly in the last year, which is a very prescient judgment. If the household debt ratio is allowed to continue to climb, it will inevitably lead to a huge crisis. Therefore, we must strictly guard against the hidden financial risks.",所以，现阶段中国家庭债务率的水平达到了46.8%的高位是一件非常需要警惕的问题，这个数据在目前来看还是低于发达国家水平，但是问题的苗头已经开始出现，国家从去年开始就反复强调去杠杆问题，这是一件非常有先见之明的判断，家庭债务率如果放任其继续攀升的话，必然会引发巨大的风险，所以要严防金融风险的出现。

"It's unclear just how deeply such collective action may take root this fall, but it certainly would be fitting if the general strike returned to the Northwest in 2019. And from there we can only hope that its spirit will spread even further, into the heart of Midwestern farming, Southern manufacturing, Texan oil fields, Appalachian coal mines, Northeastern construction, the Silicon Valley tech giants, and everywhere in between. Lord knows that something's gotta give.",今年秋季，这类集体行动的开展将深入到何种程度，目前尚不明确，但如果大罢工在 2019 年重返西北地区，那肯定也是恰当的。我们只能借此希望行动的精神能够进一步传播到中西部农业、南部制造业、德克萨斯州油田、阿巴拉契亚煤矿、东北建筑业、硅谷科技巨头以及中间的任何领域和行业。老天知道，凡事皆要付出代价。

"Then again, they said the same about Severn Cullis-Suzuki in 1992. Long before Thunberg deadpanned to parliamentarians that ""we probably don't even have a future any more,"" and netizens tore each other to shreds attacking and defending her, 12-year-old Cullis-Suzuki became known as the ""The girl who silenced the world for five minutes"" when she delivered a similar sermon before the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.",话说回来，1992 年这些媒体也是这么评价铃木瑟玟的。早在通贝里冷面控诉各国官员“我们可能都没有未来了”之前，网民就分裂成了完全对立的两派 - 铃木瑟玟的反对派和支持派；当时，在里约热内卢召开的联合国地球峰会上，时年 12 岁的铃木瑟玟进行了类似的疾呼，人们称她为“让世界沉默了五分钟的女孩”。

"This entire collection, Wanderers, that was named after planets, was not to me really about fashion per se, but it provided an opportunity to speculate about the future of our race on our planet and beyond, to combine scientific insight with lots of mystery and to move away from the age of the machine to a new age of symbiosis between our bodies, the microorganisms that we inhabit, our products and even our buildings.",这整套称为【漫游者】的 以各行星命名的系列服饰， 对我来说并不只是时尚本身， 它还提供了一个机会， 让我们想象人类在地球甚至地球以外的未来。 以及进一步地 将科学视角和很多神秘事物结合。 远离机器的时代， 进入一个新时代，让我们的身体， 我们身边的微生物， 我们的产品甚至我们的建筑可以共生。

Young people have largely led the protests that started in June over an extradition bill that the government has now agreed to withdraw. But the movement has since drawn wider participation as it snowballed into a wider anti-China campaign against what protesters say is Beijing's creeping intrusion into Hong Kong's autonomy promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.,从 6 月份开始，年轻人主要抗议引渡法案，政府现在已经同意撤回该法案。但自那以来，该抗议活动吸引了更多的参与者，滚雪球般演变为一场更大的反对中国政府的运动，反对抗议者所说的北京方面正在悄悄侵扰香港的自治权；香港曾是英国的殖民地，其主权 1997 年回归中国，当时中国政府承诺对香港实行自治。

"While Democrats want Mr. Trump impeached over his dealings with Ukraine, the president and his allies have counterattacked with their own Ukraine-focused scandals.
